# YOLOmux

Browser tools for watching, driving, and summarizing tmux sessions.

`yolomux.py` serves an interactive UI that attaches browser xterm.js terminals to local tmux sessions and adds agent-aware controls around them. Two companion tools ship alongside it: `auto_approve_tmux.py` (YOLO auto-approval without the UI) and `tmux_wall.py` (a read-only snapshot wall).

Developer / AI-agent docs (conventions, architecture, code layout, API reference) live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). This README covers installation and daily use.

## Quickstart

Run YOLOmux on the machine that owns the tmux sessions. It needs Python 3 and tmux. (Claude and Codex are optional — the `+ Claude` / `+ Codex` buttons only appear when those commands are on the server `PATH`.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keivenchang/yolomux.git
cd yolomux
tmux new-session -A -s project1     # start (or attach) a tmux session
python3 yolomux.py                  # serves on port 9998 by default
```

Then open `http://localhost:9998/`. On first launch you must enable a login account — see [Authentication & roles](#authentication--roles).

## Concepts

YOLOmux follows terminal-app terminology (iTerm2-style):

- **Pane** — a visible split region of the layout. The workspace has a left and right side; each side is one full-height pane or two stacked, for up to four panes. A pane holds zero or more tabs but shows ONE at a time (the others sit minimized in its tab strip), and has its own toolbar.
- **Tab** — the thing shown inside a pane. Each tab is one of a small, GROWING set of types: a **tmux session** (terminal), the **Finder** (the file browser — labeled **File Explorer** off macOS; **Finder and File Explorer are the same tab, just the per-OS name**), a **File** (text editor or image viewer — one type, chosen by the file's kind), **Preferences**, **Changes**, or **YO!agent** — with more types over time. Tabs are numbered `1`–`9` by display order, and each is **active** (shown in a pane), **minimized** (in a pane's tab strip, not shown), or **inactive** (not assigned to any pane).

YOLOmux's own layout is just **Panes** and **Tabs** — there is no YOLOmux "window":

```
Workspace
└─ Pane          up to 4 split regions; each has its own toolbar
   └─ Tab        one shown at a time; the rest minimized in the pane's tab strip
```

When a Tab is a **tmux session**, that session has its OWN internal hierarchy — which belongs to tmux, not YOLOmux:

```
tmux session     = one YOLOmux Tab
└─ window        Ctrl-b n / p  (and the pane toolbar's  <  /  > )
   └─ pane       Ctrl-b %  /  "    — a split INSIDE a tmux window
```

So "window" only ever means a **tmux window** (the thing `Ctrl-b n/p` cycles); it is not a YOLOmux term. And watch the overloaded word **pane**: a **YOLOmux Pane** is a browser layout split that shows one Tab, whereas a **tmux pane** is a split inside a tmux window — same word, different layers.

## Daily use

Open YOLOmux, enable a login if the setup page asks, then refresh. Existing tmux sessions appear as tabs inside panes:

- Click a tab to show it in that pane.
- Use the `Tabs` menu to activate minimized or inactive tabs.
- Drag a tab between pane tab bars, or onto a pane, to move or split the layout. Dropping in the middle of a pane moves the tab into that pane's tab bar; dropping near an edge splits the pane when there is room.
- The pane toolbar steps through the focused session's tmux windows (`<` / `>`, a tmux feature), shows transcripts (`Tx`), asks for an AI summary (`AI`), opens the event log (`Log`), and collapses the info row (`Info`).
- The terminal border turns yellow for the pane that is focused and ready for typing.

The `YO` button toggles YOLO auto-approval for a tmux session. The visible tmux screen stays the approval trigger: YOLOmux only sends the approval key when a selectable prompt is visible and the rule engine says it is safe. The default prompt source is hybrid, so recent Claude/Codex JSONL can rescue prompt type or command context when the pane text is incomplete; set `yolo.prompt_source: pane` to disable transcript rescue. YOLO state is stored in `~/.config/yolomux/state.json`, so it survives page reloads and server restarts.

## UI features

- The menu bar contains `File`, `View`, `tmux`, `Tabs`, and `Help`. `File` opens the File Explorer / Finder, Preferences, and logout flow; `tmux` creates and manages the currently focused tmux session; `Tabs` navigates active, minimized, and inactive tabs.
- The `Tabs` menu lists tabs with compact rich rows separated by bars. It does not print section headers such as Active, Minimized, or Inactive.
- The `Tabs` menu shows a small count badge when YOLO is enabled for one or more sessions. `tmux` has the current session's YO button at the top, direct `+ Claude` / `+ Codex` / `+ Term` launch items, session actions, and the `YOLO` rule actions at the bottom.
- By default YOLOmux shows existing tmux sessions, capped at nine visible session tabs (`1`–`9`). It does not create default `yolomuxN` sessions.
- `+ Claude` / `+ Codex` create the next numbered tmux session with that agent (e.g. `7` when six exist). Each appears only when that CLI is on the server `PATH`; if neither is, YOLOmux shows `+ Term` and creates a plain shell session.
- Each session tab has its own `YO` button, status badges, session label, compact work description, and hide button.
- The layout is encoded in the page URL (`sessions`, `layout`, `tabs`), so a reload — or a bookmarked link — preserves the exact layout without browser storage.
- Mouse-wheel scrolling in a terminal sends tmux copy-mode scroll commands instead of scrolling the AI input area.
- Browser resize fits xterm immediately; the tmux resize is debounced until the resize settles.
- The pane frame controls always use the PC-style controls (`_`, zoom, close) for consistency across platforms. The `?platform=pc` / `?platform=mac` override still affects labels such as File Explorer versus Finder.
- Use the platform app modifier (`⌘` on Mac, `Ctrl` on PC) for app shortcuts: app-modifier+K or Shift+app-modifier+P opens the command palette, app-modifier+P opens file quick-open, and app-modifier+comma opens Preferences when the browser delivers that shortcut to the page. In a normal browser tab, app-modifier+comma is best-effort because browsers may reserve it for their own settings; `File` -> `Preferences` and the command palette are the guaranteed paths. On Mac, Ctrl stays reserved for tmux. The command palette searches tabs, menu actions, and settings from one centered popup; file quick-open searches files under the active session cwd/repo with recently opened files first. The `Tabs` menu also has its own fuzzy search box at the top.
- `File` -> `Preferences` opens a draggable tab backed by `~/.config/yolomux/settings.yaml`. UI saves are atomic, running servers reload hand edits by polling the file, and open browsers poll `/api/settings` so changes made in another server instance apply without restart. Preferences focuses the search box on open, has a green `YOsearch` action, a two-step bottom GLOBAL reset-to-defaults warning, collapsed sections that remember their state, auto-focus off by default, independent terminal/editor/Finder font-size controls, separate dark/light editor scheme defaults, and the active YOLO rules path/source.
- The `Changes` virtual tab shows AI-attributed file changes for a selected tmux session. It combines Claude/Codex edit tool calls with repo status (`git diff --name-status HEAD` plus untracked files), groups rows by repo, and opens changed/new files in the editor.
- Observability APIs expose compact run history plus search across captured events and current session summaries.
- Transient terminal disconnects keep the existing xterm screen and scrollback. YOLOmux reconnects the WebSocket in place and shows a pane-level reconnect toast instead of writing disconnect text into the terminal buffer.

## Files and editors

Open `File` -> `File Explorer` (`Finder` on macOS) to browse the server filesystem. The root path field is editable: press Enter to jump to a typed path, use Escape to revert, and use the copy button to copy the current root path. The `Root` / `Sync` toggle chooses whether the explorer stays on a fixed root or follows the focused tmux session's current directory.

Single-clicking a file selects it in Finder/File Explorer; double-clicking opens it as a tab in the largest available pane, reusing an existing editor pane when one is already open. Double-clicking a directory makes it the Finder/File Explorer root. Text files can be edited and saved. The editor engine is CodeMirror. If CodeMirror cannot load, YOLOmux shows a read-only raw-text view with an error instead of silently falling back to a second editor engine. The default dark editor palette is YOLOmux Dark and the default light palette is VS Code Light+; Preferences exposes separate dark and light scheme selectors used by the editor dark/white toggle. The editor has a compact icon toolbar for edit, preview, split preview, side preview, line numbers, wrap, in-file Find, diff, dark/white theme, reload, save, and pane controls. CodeMirror also handles common power keys with the platform app modifier: replace, go to line, toggle comment, plus `Tab` indent and `Shift+Tab` outdent; the editor status bar shows line/column and selection counts. Preview/Split is offered only for files that render: Markdown renders as formatted HTML, and HTML/HTM renders in a sandboxed iframe with JavaScript disabled. Split mode keeps the editor and preview panes scrolled together by source line; side preview opens the same file in the largest existing non-Finder pane when one is available, otherwise it creates a side split. Diff mode shows CodeMirror's side-by-side merge view when the pane is wide and unified inline diff when narrow; modified-file clicks open directly in diff mode, and FROM/TO refs default to working tree versus `HEAD` while allowing older commit comparisons. Preview tabs are marked as preview so the same file can appear in two panes without ambiguous tab names. The wrap and line-number toggles are shared by editor tabs. Editor auto-save is on by default and saves dirty tabs after `editor.autosave_delay_seconds` only when the file has not changed on disk; if disk content changes, clean buffers reload when auto-save is on, otherwise they show the Reload button, and editing a changed buffer prompts before the later save-conflict dialog. Wrapped continuation rows show a `↪` marker through CodeMirror decorations. Markdown, fenced Markdown code blocks, shell, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, JSON, HTML/XML/SVG, CSS, TOML, and YAML get syntax coloring. Files over the configured raw-read cap show a too-large state instead of loading into the editor. If an open file disappears from disk, its file tab changes color and strikes through the filename. Dragging a file from Finder/File Explorer onto a pane or pane tab opens it as a file tab.

Finder/File Explorer includes a fixed modified-files panel at the bottom. It is grouped by repo root for the focused tmux session, uses `/api/session-files`, shows changes since the default branch merge-base plus working-tree changes, includes git `+added` / `-removed` counts, and stays attached to the Finder pane when the pane is moved or resized. The panel defaults to detailed rows and has one density toggle for compact/detailed display, skinny A/M/D status chips, agent icons, condensed dates, a vertical resizer, per-session cached content during tmux switches, and silent refreshes that preserve scroll and skip DOM replacement when the file list did not change. Clicking a changed file opens the editable CodeMirror file, records the owning session on the file tab, and decorates changed lines from `/api/fs/diff`; filesystem polling refreshes the list and existing diff markers. Repo directory rows show cached branch metadata and aggregate `+added` / `-removed` totals inline, with branch info included in `/api/fs/list` so visible repos do not wait for hover. The path bar includes quick-root buttons and a cached repo summary with branch, dirty count, and ahead/behind details when the root is inside a git repo.

`YO!agent` shows a global AI activity roll-up above the branch table. It starts with a human-readable sentence about the most recent work, what is changing, and why, then lists running agents by session, repo, current goal/work, CI status, and changed-file totals; per-session tab popups show the matching local summary. The server caches summaries by transcript/git/file signatures, so unchanged sessions reuse the previous result instead of recomputing on every poll. The No agent backend is the zero-token default. If Preferences selects a Claude or Codex CLI backend, YO!agent keeps one resumable CLI conversation per YOLOmux server, seeds it with the summarized activity once, then sends only the next question plus changed summary context after that; prod and dev intentionally do not share one mutable CLI session. YO!agent's prompt includes a README-derived primer for YOLOmux concepts, so it can answer questions about panes, tabs, tmux windows, Finder/File Explorer, splitting, Preferences, Changes, and YOLO without reading files at question time.

YO!agent context comes from this chain: tmux sessions are YOLOmux tabs; YOLOmux detects Claude/Codex agents running in those sessions; those agents point to session transcript JSONL files when available; YOLOmux combines transcript activity with git metadata and changed-file summaries; YO!agent reports insights from that summarized state. If a session has no detected agent or no transcript, YO!agent may know the tmux session exists but will have little or no activity insight for it.

Images open in the same tab system. Small images render at their original size; large images fit the available pane. Click the image to toggle between fit mode and original-size scroll mode. Finder/File Explorer hover previews are delayed like tab popovers, capped by the `file_explorer.image_preview_max_px` preference (default `320`), and close when the pointer leaves the file row.

Right-click a file or directory for file actions: copy the full path, copy the raw path, copy a repo-relative path when one exists, download files, rename, or delete. Shift-click selects a range; Cmd-click on Mac or Ctrl-click on PC toggles individual rows. Dragging file rows into terminals sends the shell-quoted path text.

## Development notes

The interactive frontend is edited in ordered partials under `static_src/js/yolomux/` and `static_src/css/yolomux/`. Run `python3 tools/static_build.py` after changing those files; it rebuilds the served single-file assets `static/yolomux.js` and `static/yolomux.css`. Run `python3 tools/static_build.py --check` before committing so generated assets cannot drift from source.

## Running it

Choose specific sessions:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --sessions project1,project2
```

Run on a shared development host:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9998
```

Run a background server with logs under `/tmp`:

```bash
setsid nohup env TERM=xterm-256color PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 yolomux.py --host 0.0.0.0 > /tmp/yolomux.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

## HTTPS / TLS

HTTPS is off by default. To run with a generated self-signed certificate:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --port 9998 --self-signed
```

Then open `https://localhost:9998/`. The browser warns because the certificate is self-signed. YOLOmux stores the generated PEM files under `~/.local/state/yolomux/tls/` and reuses them across restarts. To use your own certificate:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --port 9998 --cert /path/fullchain.pem --key /path/privkey.pem
```

## Authentication & roles

**First launch.** YOLOmux creates `~/.config/yolomux/auth.yaml` as an inactive starter (directory `0700`, file `0600`; existing auth files are tightened on read, and an old default `user` / `password` file is replaced):

- The starter leaves `users:` uncommented but **comments out** every account: an admin entry for your login user (with a random generated password) and a readonly `guest` / `guest` entry. No login works until you uncomment one.
- Until an account is active, the server still listens but serves only a setup page (and prints a stdout warning) telling you to edit the file.
- YOLOmux re-reads `auth.yaml` on each setup poll, so the page reloads after you save — no restart needed.

Example `auth.yaml`:

```yaml
users:
  - username: "keivenc"
    password: "change-this-admin-password"
    role: "admin"
  - username: "guest"
    password: "guest"
    role: "readonly"
```

**Sessions & cookies.** Once an account is active, browser navigation shows the login page and stores an HttpOnly cookie:

- The cookie has a 90-day sliding lifetime and survives server restarts — the signing secret lives in `~/.config/yolomux/auth-cookie-secret`. Changing a user's password or deleting that secret invalidates existing cookies.
- Cookies are scoped by port, so dev and production servers on the same host do not overwrite each other.
- HTTP Basic auth also works for clients that send an `Authorization` header.
- Served without HTTPS, YOLOmux warns and recommends restarting with `--self-signed`.

**Roles.**

| Role | Can do |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` | Type into tmux panes, create sessions, upload files, toggle `YO`, change Notify, switch tmux windows, run AI summaries. |
| `readonly` | View panes, transcripts, branch metadata, logs, and YOLO status. Terminals attach with `tmux attach-session -r`; mutating HTTP endpoints are rejected. |

## Agent permissions & YOLO

Agent launch flags are separate from YOLOmux's per-session `YO` toggle.

**Launching agents by hand.** Claude's auto permission mode still uses Claude's permission system but auto-handles more decisions:

```bash
claude --permission-mode auto
```

Claude's full bypass is `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. The current Codex CLI has no `--yolo` flag; the closest no-prompt setting removes approval prompts but keeps the sandbox policy:

```bash
codex --ask-for-approval never
```

Codex's full approval-and-sandbox bypass is `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.

**`--dangerously-yolo` (server flag).** Use it only when you intentionally want sessions that YOLOmux creates to launch with the dangerous bypass flags:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9998 --dangerously-yolo
```

With it enabled, `+ Claude` / `+ Codex` create sessions with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. Without it, the same buttons create plain `claude` and `codex` sessions. The flag affects only new sessions created after the server starts; it does not change existing tmux sessions, and it is separate from the `YO` toggle.

**The `YO` toggle (runtime).** `YO` is per-session auto-approval for an *existing* tmux session. It watches the visible tmux screen and sends the approval key when the rule engine says the prompt is safe. It does not relaunch the agent and does not change the agent's own permission or sandbox flags.

**Rule file.** YOLOmux reads ordered rules from `~/.config/yolomux/yolo-rules.yaml` when that file exists. The file's top-level `default:` value is the canonical fallback action when no rule matches; there is no separate live `default_policy` preference. Rules are first-match-wins and support `command`, `regex`, `glob`, and `contains` matches with `approve`, `decline`, `block`, `ask`, `notify`, or `off` actions. The tmux -> YOLO menu has `Open rule file` and `Reload rules`; Preferences shows the active path, source, rule count, and dry-run state. If the file is missing, YOLOmux uses a built-in fallback that preserves the previous dangerous-command block list while continuing to approve non-dangerous bash prompts. Saving the rule file through the editor validates the YAML first and shows errors inline; an already-invalid on-disk file fails safe to `ask` and is surfaced in the UI and server stderr instead of silently allowing prompts.

Example:

```yaml
default: ask
rules:
  - name: block destructive
    type: command
    match: [rm, rmdir, shred, dd, mkfs]
    action: block
    risk: delete
  - name: safe reads
    type: regex
    match: '^(ls|cat|grep|git (status|log|diff))\b'
    action: approve
    risk: read
```

The YAML cannot relax the hard floor for `rm -rf /`, `dd` to block devices, fork bombs, `mkfs`, or redirection to block devices unless the server itself was started with `--dangerously-yolo`. Set `yolo.dry_run: true` in Preferences or `settings.yaml` to log what the rule engine would do without pressing an approval key.

## Remote access

The safer default is to keep YOLOmux bound to localhost on the server and tunnel it from your client:

```bash
autossh -M 0 -N -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -L 9998:127.0.0.1:9998 user@server
```

Then open `http://localhost:9998/` on the client.

If you bind with `--host 0.0.0.0`, the host firewall or cloud security group must allow the port — open TCP `9998` only from trusted client IPs. Do not expose the port broadly just because YOLOmux has authentication; the browser terminal can type into your tmux sessions.

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <client-ip> to any port 9998 proto tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="<client-ip>" port protocol="tcp" port="9998" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## xterm.js assets

YOLOmux serves xterm.js from a local editor install when available. It checks `YOLOMUX_XTERM_ROOTS` first, then `static/xterm`, then common Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf server installs under the home directory. If `/static/xterm.js` or `/static/xterm.css` is missing, the browser falls back to jsDelivr.

## Companion: `auto_approve_tmux.py`

The standalone auto-approval tool — use it when you want YOLO behavior without the browser UI. It runs on the same server as tmux, polls the visible pane text with `tmux capture-pane`, optionally uses recent JSONL transcript activity to fill in missing prompt context, detects Claude/Codex approval prompts, and sends the approval key with `tmux send-keys`.

```bash
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --list                  # list tmux sessions
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --dry-run --once project1   # preview one visible prompt
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py project1                 # watch one session
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py project1 project2        # watch several
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py project1,project2
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py "project*"               # glob
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py project1:0.1             # watch one window/pane
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --verbose --dry-run project1   # debug detection
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --prompt-source pane project1  # visible pane only
```

Run it in the background:

```bash
setsid nohup env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --interval 0.5 "project*" > /tmp/auto_approve_tmux.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

YOLOmux and this script share the same detector. YOLOmux imports `auto_approve_tmux.py` as a module, wraps one `AutoApproveWorker` around each enabled session, and runs detected bash prompts through `yolomux_lib/yolo_rules.py` before sending tmux keys (flow: `JS YO button -> POST /api/auto-approve -> TmuxWebtermApp.set_auto_approve -> AutoApproveWorker -> auto_approve_tmux.py detector -> optional transcript rescue -> yolo_rules.py -> tmux send-keys`).

Detection intentionally uses the visible tmux screen for presence checks, which avoids approving stale prompts left in scrollback after the agent moved on. It recognizes active Codex working rows such as `• Working (4m 06s • esc to interrupt)`, and color rotation is not a blocker because `tmux capture-pane -p` returns text without terminal color styling. Dangerous shell commands are blocked by the default rules instead of approved.

## Companion: `tmux_wall.py` (read-only wall)

An optional read-only sidecar dashboard — useful when you only want a passive wall of terminal snapshots and JSON context, not the full interactive UI. It is a stdlib HTTP server that uses `tmux capture-pane` as the source, streams snapshots over Server-Sent Events, exposes JSON endpoints (for a future AI summarizer, without scraping the browser), optionally reads `container/show_project_containers.py` for container metadata, and serves `static/tmux-wall.css` / `static/tmux-wall.js`.

```bash
python3 tmux_wall.py --port 8765                     # then open http://localhost:8765/
python3 tmux_wall.py --print-targets                 # inspect target selection without starting
python3 tmux_wall.py --targets project1:0.0,project2:0.0,project3:1.0,project4:0.0 --slots 6
```

The wall has no login layer, so it refuses non-loopback binds by default. If you intentionally want to expose read-only tmux snapshots on `0.0.0.0`, pass `--allow-unauthenticated-non-loopback`.

Without `--targets`, the server discovers panes from `project1` through `project4`, picks one agent pane per session first, then fills the remaining slots with other panes from those sessions. The wall API reference is in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
