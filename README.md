# YOLOmux

Browser tools for watching, driving, and summarizing tmux sessions.

`yolomux.py` serves an interactive UI that attaches browser xterm.js terminals to local tmux sessions and adds agent-aware controls around them. Two companion tools ship alongside it: `auto_approve_tmux.py` (YOLO auto-approval without the UI) and `tmux_wall.py` (a read-only snapshot wall).

Developer / AI-agent docs (conventions, architecture, code layout, API reference) live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Contributing and build instructions are in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Development Checks

Before committing local changes, run the parallel check gate:

```bash
python3 tools/check.py
```

Use `python3 tools/check.py --list-lanes` to see focused lanes, `--lane <name>` for a smaller run, and `--serial` when debugging order or load-sensitive failures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- tmux
- `openssl` on `PATH` (only needed for `--self-signed` HTTPS)

## Quickstart

Recommended local run: HTTPS, login-gated, and YOLO-enabled for new Claude/Codex sessions created from the UI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keivenchang/yolomux.git
cd yolomux
pip install -r requirements.txt
tmux new-session -A -s project1     # start (or attach) a tmux session
python3 yolomux.py --self-signed --dang
```

Open `https://localhost:9998/`. The first launch shows a setup page — see [First launch](#first-launch) below. `--self-signed` creates a local HTTPS certificate under `~/.local/state/yolomux/tls/`; your browser will warn because it is not signed by a public CA. `--dang` is the short alias for `--dangerously-yolo`, which makes the UI's `+ Claude` and `+ Codex` buttons launch with their approval/sandbox bypass flags.

## First launch

On first run YOLOmux creates `~/.config/yolomux/auth.yaml` with every account commented out. No login works until you uncomment one:

```bash
# edit the file — nano, vim, whatever you prefer
nano ~/.config/yolomux/auth.yaml
```

Uncomment the admin entry (it uses your login username and a random generated password):

```yaml
users:
  - username: "yourname"
    password: "generated-password-shown-in-file"
    role: "admin"
```

Save the file. The setup page polls and reloads automatically — no server restart needed. Then log in.

To add a read-only guest account, uncomment (or add) a `readonly` entry:

```yaml
  - username: "guest"
    password: "guest"
    role: "readonly"
```

## Concepts

YOLOmux follows terminal-app terminology (iTerm2-style):

- **Pane** — a visible split region of the layout. Panes tile via draggable splits and can be nested arbitrarily (drag a tab to a pane edge to split, or to its header to add a tab). A pane holds one or more tabs but shows ONE at a time.
- **Tab** — the thing shown inside a pane. Tab types: **tmux session** (terminal), **Finder / File Explorer** (file browser with `Differ` mode), **File** (text editor or image viewer), **Preferences**, and **YO!agent**.

When a Tab is a tmux session, that session has its own internal hierarchy — tmux windows (`Ctrl-b n/p`) and tmux panes (`Ctrl-b %/"`) — which belong to tmux, not YOLOmux. Watch the overloaded word **pane**: a YOLOmux Pane is a browser layout split, a tmux pane is a split inside a tmux window.

## Daily use

Open YOLOmux after setup. Existing tmux sessions appear as tabs. (The detailed pane/tab/Finder/Differ behavior contract lives in [`docs/GUI_SPECS.md`](docs/GUI_SPECS.md); this list is the daily-driver essentials.)

- Click a tab to show it in that pane. Use the `Tabs` menu to activate minimized or inactive tabs.
- Drag a tab between pane tab bars to move it, drop near a pane edge to split that pane, or drop on the outer root edge for a full-span pane. Pane splits are percentage-based and encode into the shareable page URL.
- Pinned tabs stay at the front of their pane and cannot be dragged into another pane.
- Drag a Finder or Differ file row into a pane to open that file there; dropping near a pane edge opens it in a new split.
- Browser uploads from drag-drop, clipboard paste, or the `+` button default into a `.uploads/` subdirectory of the resolved target directory. The `uploads.subdir` Preference controls that folder; setting it blank restores the old direct-to-target behavior.
- Finder / File Explorer is docked by default on fresh and sessions-only URLs. Hiding it with `Mod+B`, the close button, or File -> Finder shows the restore shortcut in the status line.
- The pane info line shows one button per tmux window (`0:bash`, `1:codex`, ...); clicking a button switches that session to the matching tmux window. The pane toolbar shows transcripts (`Tx`), asks for an AI summary (`AI`), and opens the event log (`Log`).
- Finder switches between the file tree and a full-pane `Differ` mode (per-repo FROM/TO diff controls). The root toggle defaults to `Sync`, which follows the focused session's affected repos and highlights changed paths.
- A third `Tabber` mode lists open tabs and each tmux session's windows (and the paths each agent touched), sorted by most recent activity — click a session to focus it, a window row to switch tmux windows.
- Finder browsing defaults to the filesystem root (`/`); credential-heavy paths such as `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.config/gh`, token files, and registry config files are blocked and hidden from search/index results.
- Quick Search (`Mod+P`) ranks filename matches ahead of path-only fuzzy matches; image hits render as `[Image #1] '/abs/path.png'` references.
- The language picker in the top bar, login/setup screens, and Preferences supports English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Arabic, German, Russian, Hindi, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Turkish, Hebrew, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, and Italian.
- The file editor's `Differ` toggle opens a diff view with a FROM/TO sha picker for any git-tracked file with commit history, even when the working tree is clean.
- Markdown Preview task checkboxes are editable for admin users: clicking a rendered `- [ ]` / `- [x]` item updates the underlying Markdown source through the normal dirty/autosave path.
- Sessions waiting at a detected permission prompt show an attention badge in the roster even when YOLO auto-approval is off, so pending `Yes/No` prompts do not silently sit idle.

### Copying terminal text

- Select text and press `Cmd-C` (Mac) / `Ctrl-C` (PC) to copy it to your browser clipboard. While a full-screen app like Claude owns the mouse, a normal drag goes to the app instead of making a selection — hold `Option` (Mac) / `Shift` (PC) and drag to force a real terminal selection, or just select inside the app: its own copy (sent as an OSC 52 escape) is forwarded to your browser clipboard automatically (the status line shows `copied N chars`).
- `Cmd-C` with nothing selected does nothing — it is never delivered to the running program. Plain `Ctrl-C` with nothing selected still sends `SIGINT` to interrupt the program.
- To copy the tmux copy-mode selection (server-side, via tmux), press `Cmd-Option-C` (Mac) / `Ctrl-Alt-C` (PC), or right-click and choose `Copy tmux selection`.
- Right-click keeps the current selection highlighted and offers `Copy` / `Copy without indent`.

The `YO` button toggles YOLO auto-approval for a tmux session. See [Agent permissions & YOLO](#agent-permissions--yolo).

## Running options

Specific sessions only:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --sessions project1,project2 --self-signed --dang
```

Custom port (default is `9998`, host defaults to `0.0.0.0`):

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --port 8080 --self-signed --dang
```

Background server:

```bash
setsid nohup env TERM=xterm-256color PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 yolomux.py --self-signed --dang > /tmp/yolomux.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

## HTTPS / TLS

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --self-signed          # auto-generated cert, stored in ~/.local/state/yolomux/tls/
python3 yolomux.py --cert fullchain.pem --key privkey.pem   # bring your own
```

`--self-signed` requires `openssl` on `PATH`. Browsers warn because the certificate is self-signed; proceed past the warning.

## Authentication & roles

| Role | Can do |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` | Type into tmux panes, create sessions, upload files, toggle `YO`, switch tmux windows, run AI summaries. |
| `readonly` | View panes, transcripts, branch metadata, logs, and YOLO status. Terminals are read-only. |

Cookies have a 90-day sliding lifetime and survive server restarts. Cookies are scoped by port, so dev and production servers on the same host do not overwrite each other. Changing a user's password invalidates existing cookies for that user.

## Agent permissions & YOLO

**Launching agents.** Claude's auto permission mode:

```bash
claude --permission-mode auto        # auto-handles most decisions
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions  # full bypass
codex --ask-for-approval never       # no approval prompts, sandbox still active
codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox  # full bypass
```

**`--dang` / `--dangerously-yolo` (server flag).** Makes `+ Claude` / `+ Codex` buttons launch with the full bypass flags:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --self-signed --dang
```

Without it, those buttons create plain `claude` / `codex` sessions. This flag does not change existing sessions.

**The `YO` toggle.** Per-session auto-approval for an existing tmux session. It watches the visible tmux screen and sends the approval key when the rule engine says the prompt is safe. Rules live in `~/.config/yolomux/yolo-rules.yaml`:

```yaml
default: ask
rules:
  - name: block destructive
    type: command
    match: [rm, rmdir, shred, dd, mkfs]
    action: block
    risk: delete
  - name: safe reads
    type: regex
    match: '^(ls|cat|grep|git (status|log|diff))\b'
    action: approve
    risk: read
```

The `tmux` menu has `Open rule file` and `Reload rules`. Set `yolo.dry_run: true` in Preferences to log what the rule engine would do without pressing a key.

The optional `risk:` field is a label shown in the YOLO event log. Keep it to the boring concrete set so the audit display stays consistent: `read`, `edit`, `network`, `process`, `delete`, `credential`, `unknown`. Any other string is accepted (the engine never rejects a rule for its risk label), it just won't be standardized.

## Remote access

YOLOmux binds `--host 0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) by default, on purpose: the product is built for reaching your sessions from a phone or another machine on a trusted LAN, and every request is gated by the login layer. If that's your setup, restrict the port to trusted IPs at the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <client-ip> to any port 9998 proto tcp
```

To keep YOLOmux local-only instead, bind loopback and tunnel from your client:

```bash
python3 yolomux.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9998 --self-signed --dang
autossh -M 0 -N -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -L 9998:127.0.0.1:9998 user@server
```

## Companion: `auto_approve_tmux.py`

Standalone YOLO auto-approval without the browser UI:

```bash
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --list                       # list tmux sessions
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --dry-run --once project1    # preview one visible prompt
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py project1                     # watch one session
python3 auto_approve_tmux.py "project*"                   # glob
```

Background:

```bash
setsid nohup env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python3 auto_approve_tmux.py --interval 0.5 "project*" > /tmp/auto_approve.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

## Companion: `tmux_wall.py`

Read-only snapshot wall — passive view of terminal panes with no login layer (refuses non-loopback by default):

```bash
python3 tmux_wall.py --port 8765
python3 tmux_wall.py --targets project1:0.0,project2:0.0 --slots 4
```
