    UID is NOT consulted. An earlier revision skipped a denial only when the process UID differed

    or be handed the descriptor. Worse, that skip was silent, so an accessible process and a denied
    process sharing one inode returned a single PID and satisfied the exact-one gate.

    Only EACCES/EPERM is degradation. Every other errno stays fatal, because EIO or ENOMEM

    either can promise: `ss -ltnp` prints an owner only for sockets the caller may inspect, so a
    snapshot containing one PID is evidence that one holder exists, never that no other holder was
    hidden. Accepting it as complete reintroduced the exact false-uniqueness the /proc owner exists
    to prevent, and it did so on the developer hosts that DO have `ss` while the gate container,
    which has neither tool, was the only place the safe path ran.

    A non-Linux host has no /proc to walk, so it uses `lsof` and carries an explicit global

    processes - and refusing on them makes identity impossible. It refuses on any TARGET record.

    This mode does NOT prove that an unreadable co-holder cannot share an already mapped inode. It
    is not a whole-host assertion and must not be described as one.

    STRICT is the whole-host assertion: it refuses on any degradation at all, including global
