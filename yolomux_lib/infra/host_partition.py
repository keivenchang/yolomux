"""One place that decides where a host's private state lives.

`/home` can be exported and mounted by another machine at the same absolute
path, so a default under the shared root puts two hosts on one file. For SQLite
that is not merely a race: WAL requires every user of a database to be on one
host and is unsupported on a network filesystem.

Every store that needs a per-host location calls here. It is deliberately one
function rather than a convention each store re-implements -- divergent copies
of one value is the defect shape this codebase keeps hitting, and a store that
partitioned differently from its readers would be invisible until data went
missing.
