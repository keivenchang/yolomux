"""The one owner of the `/api/system-status` body, and the one place it is retained.

The Daemons panel polls `/api/system-status` every five seconds while it is visible. Every one of
those requests used to assemble the whole diagnostic report on the request thread: local-service
projection, cache-directory walks, transcript scans, a full `json.dumps`, and the response
envelope's `copy.deepcopy` of the encoded body. Measured on the live host that was 0.18 s
typically, 1.002 s at load, and one construction was observed at 5 s - a diagnostic view that got
slower exactly when the server was in trouble and the reader needed it.

This module holds the two things that fixes:

* `SnapshotSlot` - one publish slot. A producer builds a body, the slot rebinds one immutable
  `Snapshot` reference, and readers take that reference. There is no lock on the read path and no
  partially-updated state, because a published snapshot is never mutated.
* `SystemStatusSnapshotOwner` - one background thread that drives one or more slots on a cadence,
  and the typed read the route returns.

Two rules this module exists to enforce, both of them defects this codebase has had before:

1. **A reader never builds.** `read()` cannot call a producer. The slowest thing it can do is
   record demand and wake the owner thread. A route that rebuilds synchronously when the cache is
   cold has simply moved the 5 s construction to the unluckiest reader.
2. **A stale snapshot is never presented as current.** Past the freshness deadline the read is
   `stale`, carries the age that made it stale and a machine-readable reason, and does NOT carry
   the aged body. The whole point of this panel is to tell a reader what is true right now; a body
   labelled `generated_at` five minutes ago and rendered as the current state is the exact failure
   the panel is supposed to detect elsewhere.

Everything time-related is injected, as in `backend_health.observer`: `monotonic` drives the
cadence and the age, `wall_clock` stamps the snapshot, and `wait` is the only blocking call in the
loop, so a test never sleeps.
