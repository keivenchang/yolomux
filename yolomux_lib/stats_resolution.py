"""Canonical YO!stats Range x Resolution policy - one server-owned source of truth.

This module is the single owner of the exact resolution universe and the preset
Range x Resolution matrix described in DOIT.1.md. statsd capabilities, cache
construction, request validation, AUTO resolution, YO!stats, and YO!cost all read
from here rather than hand-copying a second table. The browser mirrors these
values through a parity test (DOIT.1 item 6), never an independent derivation.

The whole matrix is reproducible from one formula, so a hand-edited cell that
violates the bucket budget fails a test instead of shipping:

    explicit resolutions for a range = every r in RESOLUTION_CHOICES with
        MIN_BUCKETS <= range_seconds / r <= MAX_BUCKETS
    AUTO for a range = the finest r with range_seconds / r <= MAX_BUCKETS

Every AUTO value is always also in its range's explicit set (asserted in tests).
