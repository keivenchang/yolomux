"""Persistent, stale-while-revalidate file index for quick-open search.

The live `search_files` walk re-walks a root on every keystroke and is capped
(MAX_SEARCH_DIRS / MAX_SEARCH_FILES), so a huge root like ~/nvidia is both slow
and incomplete. This module builds a per-root index of every file once (in a
background thread, respecting the same skip dirs), keeps it in memory + on disk,
and serves quick-open queries from it instantly with no per-query walk and no
50k coverage cap. It is an ACCELERATOR: callers fall back to the live walk while
an index is still building or on any error, so search never depends on it.

    and the cancel event -- so blocked siblings are already told to stop before we wait on any;
    (2) waits on each worker's COMPLETION EVENT against ONE absolute deadline shared across the batch
    (never N joins with N timeouts); (3) never closes an fd under a live or current worker -- the
    worker's own ``finally`` (``_finalize_worker_exit``) performs the deferred close when it exits, so
    a late worker still releases its fd and no descriptor is abandoned; (4) keeps every not-yet-closed
