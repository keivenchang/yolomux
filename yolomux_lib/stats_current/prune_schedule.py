"""Sole owner of the nightly YO!stats prune schedule.

Pruning is destructive maintenance, so it runs once a night at a local wall-clock
time the operator picks, not on an interval. Three rules define it, and each one
exists because its opposite fails silently:

* LOCAL TIME, RESOLVED EVERY TIME. The occurrence is computed from the system
  zone at each decision. An offset captured once at startup drifts an hour twice
  a year and then prunes at 01:30 or 03:30 forever.
* A MISSED WINDOW IS STILL DUE. The rule is "the most recent occurrence of the
  configured time has not been pruned yet", not "fire exactly at 02:30". A
  machine that is asleep every night at 02:30 still prunes the next time it runs,
  instead of never pruning while storage grows without a single symptom.
* AN UNUSABLE PREFERENCE FALLS BACK, NEVER OFF. Every parse failure resolves to
  DEFAULT_PRUNE_LOCAL_TIME and says it fell back. A preference that could disable
  cleanup would let the database grow forever with no signal.

    round trip, not ``tm_isdst=-1``, is what makes the answer stable.
    ``mktime(tm_isdst=-1)`` is explicitly unspecified for an ambiguous local time
    and glibc does return BOTH instants for the same input, which made the same
    autumn night look unpruned an hour after it had been pruned, and pruned twice.

    * Normal day: exactly one offset survives the round trip.
    * Autumn, ambiguous (the hour that happens twice): both survive; the earlier
      instant wins, so the second pass over that wall time is already behind the
      last prune and does not fire again.
    * Spring, nonexistent (the hour that is skipped): neither survives, because
      the clock never shows that time. The later instant wins -- the moment the
      clock jumps to -- so the night has exactly one occurrence instead of none.
