# a realistic store put per-family-at-ten at 83.53% fewer append bytes against per-family-at-one,
# beating merged-at-five (79.41%) without needing one transaction to span two families -- and at
# equal commit count a family-spanning commit cost 25.05% more, because it dirties both families'

# THE OPEN DESIGN PROBLEM, recorded here because this constant is where someone will come
# looking. `source_generation` is the ring's freshness key, and `_publish_ring_views` compares
# entry cursors against `_ring_published_cursors` built from it. The overlay
# (`_overlay_snapshot`) serves buffered facts WITHOUT advancing that key, so with buffering on
# the served cache carries `source_generation` 0 while showing real data -- measured, and it is
# precisely the state the freshness floor exists to refuse. Two ring correctness gates fail on
# it: `test_seeded_slow_ring_view_cannot_fall_back_to_the_startup_zero_cache` and
# `test_leader_writer_coalesces_ingest_for_ten_seconds_and_matches_materializer`. Both pass at 0.
#
# The obvious fix is NOT available. Advancing the generation for uncommitted facts would break
# "no cursor, watermark or generation leads durability" -- an invariant this change exists to
# preserve, pinned by
# `test_the_buffer_never_advances_the_generation_before_it_commits`. That tension is the
# problem, and it is a design decision rather than a bug fix.
#
# So: 0 = write through, exactly the pre-batching path, byte for byte. Set the admission
# variable to APPEND_FLUSH_MEASURED_SECONDS to select the candidate arm once the collision is
# resolved. Everything else about batching -- the probes, the quarantine, the overlay, the
# ring-durability ordering -- is implemented and tested and waits behind this one number.

    A default is not a guard. `APPEND_FLUSH_ENV_NAME` is forwarded into the test container, so
    on its own it is settable on any process -- and it selects an arm we KNOW fails two ring
    correctness gates. A silently-honoured admission variable that enables a known-broken path
    in production is the mirror image of the silently-ignored one the container allowlist exists
    to prevent: same class, opposite direction.

    So the arm is honoured only when the process ALSO carries the test-container marker, which
    `docker/run-tests.sh` sets on the container it builds and which nothing on the production
    launch path sets -- verified against the live statsd's own environment, which carries
    neither name. `tools.docker_image.running_inside_container` is deliberately NOT reused: it
    also returns true for `/.dockerenv`, so any containerised production deployment would pass
    it.

    Refusal IGNORES rather than raises. Raising would turn a stray environment variable into a
    statsd outage -- one stale export and the host loses telemetry -- while the refused state is
    write-through, which is the proven path and the one we want anyway. That is failing closed:
    the request is denied and the daemon still works. It cannot be mistaken for the feature
    working, because the refusal and the value that was asked for are both in `_status()`.

    Inside the test container the value is parsed STRICTLY and a malformed arm raises, because
    there a silently-defaulted arm measures nothing and reports a clean null.

        this daemon serves, not only by a stats watcher, so a CLI call or an unrelated local
        request reads as a watcher. That error direction is the safe one -- it keeps the
        one-second cadence when it need not, rather than backing off while someone is reading,
        which is the failure that would show a user a stale chart. It is never allowed to err
        the other way.

        The precise signal would be stream-scoped bookkeeping in `stats_current/http.py`,
        which owns `snapshot_stream` and `delta_stream` and therefore knows how many streams
        are actually open. That is a different file and a different owner; whoever tightens
        this should replace the body here and leave every caller alone.

        The chain that makes the proxy sound was traced rather than assumed: `server.py`'s SSE
        loop calls `stats_current_http.delta_stream` once per frame, which reaches
        `client.delta` -> `local_service_request` -> this daemon's `run_local_rpc_service`,
        whose `on_client` is `_on_client`. A live watcher therefore stamps on every frame.

        No silent default: `last_rpc_at` is set at construction, so the signal is always
        available and a daemon that has served nothing yet reads as WATCHED. Reading an
        unavailable signal as "unwatched" would make every cold start publish an absent CPU
        sample until its first RPC arrived.
