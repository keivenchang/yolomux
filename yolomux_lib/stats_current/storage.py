    this instead of computing bucket boundaries itself. Per-producer copies of this arithmetic are

        The ONE owner of the honest-gap transition. A pending invalidation is answered by a
        republication (`publish_ring_buckets`), and that is the only path that may retire a row
        whose bucket is still rebuildable. But a bucket that has aged out of the materializer's
        candidate window can never be rebuilt again: startup repair stages it, no candidate bucket
        exists to write, no publication answers it, and the row stays pending forever while
        `read_ring_window` hides the slot. The retained payload is then both permanently hidden and
        permanently contradicted.

        The serving decision is an honest gap: drop the contradicted payload and the row it owes in
        ONE transaction, so there is never a moment where the slot is served without its
        contradiction or the row survives its slot. Retirement is a DELETE, matching
        `_retire_unactionable_invalidations`, because no publication ever answered this row --
        stamping `applied_at` would claim a republication that did not happen.

        Exactness is the whole safety argument. The caller passes the pending row's observed source
        generation, and the transaction proceeds only while that exact row is still pending and
        the slot still holds the older bucket it contradicts. A row another publisher retired or
        replaced, or a slot that publisher rebuilt or lapped, leaves stale repair work no authority
        over the new state. Callers must only pass rows they measured to be unrebuildable.
