"""Durable single-file persistence: a cross-process file lock and an atomic write.

settings.py, events.py, and yolo_rules.py each carried their own copy of an RLock+flock contextmanager and
the same `.{name}.{pid}.{tid}.{ns}.tmp` + fsync + os.replace dance, with the durability/permission
guarantees drifting between them. This is the one owner; callers pass the permission bits as data.

Import-light (stdlib only), like cache.py, so any module can use it without import-cycle worries.
