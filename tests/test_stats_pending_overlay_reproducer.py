"""Red control and prototype for the statsd pending-fact serving overlay.

The queue item asks for batched persistence "without reducing one-second acquisition or
in-memory UI freshness".  Today those two are the same thing: a fact reaches a reader only
by being committed, because `_build_once` obtains facts exclusively through
`reader.pinned_snapshot(...)` at `service.py:2366`.  Deferring the commit to a shared
5-10 s interval therefore deletes one-second freshness unless something else serves the
not-yet-durable fact.

`test_deferring_the_commit_hides_the_fact_at_one_second` is the RED CONTROL: it proves the
coupling exists, and every claim below it is meaningless without it.  The overlay prototype
then serves the same deferred fact through the SAME builder by merging the buffered records
into the `StoreSnapshot` the builder already reads, which is why this is one builder and not
two.
