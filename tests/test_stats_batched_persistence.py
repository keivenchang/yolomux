"""Batched persistence on a shared flush interval, with one-second freshness preserved.

The queue item asks to persist telemetry on a 5-10 s interval "without reducing one-second
acquisition or in-memory UI freshness".  `test_stats_pending_overlay_reproducer.py` holds the
red control that makes this falsifiable: withhold the commit and the fact leaves the
one-second layer.  These tests drive the real service instead of a prototype.

Two facts about this workload shape the design and are asserted here rather than assumed:

  * A live collector re-offers its OPEN coverage epoch on EVERY cadence tick with `ended_at`
    advanced by one cadence (`collectors.py:184`, and the comment at `storage.py:2864`).  So
    buffering observations alone would not remove a single commit -- the coverage row still
    writes every tick.  Coverage must buffer too, and it collapses per epoch.
  * The `browser` family carries the receipt barrier and its acknowledgement transfers
    custody, so it must not buffer.

    Batching is fully implemented and tested, and it is OFF by default because the overlay
    serves buffered facts without advancing `source_generation` -- the ring's freshness key --
    so the served cache carries generation 0 while showing real data. Two ring correctness
    gates fail on exactly that:

        test_seeded_slow_ring_view_cannot_fall_back_to_the_startup_zero_cache
        test_leader_writer_coalesces_ingest_for_ten_seconds_and_matches_materializer

    Both pass at 0. Advancing the generation for uncommitted facts is not the fix: it would
    break the invariant `test_the_buffer_never_advances_the_generation_before_it_commits` pins.
    Resolve that tension first, run those two gates, and only then change this number.
