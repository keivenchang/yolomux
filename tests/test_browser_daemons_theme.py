"""Theme coverage for the Daemons roster alert.

The compact alert above the roster is the surface that announces a dead daemon, and its ONLY
container affordance is `border: 1px solid var(--warning-border-strong)`. That token had no
`body.theme-light` value, so the same near-white yellow painted in both themes and the box had no
visible outline on the light panel (measured 1.2:1, WCAG's non-text minimum is 3:1). No test in the
repo toggled a theme and measured the roster, which is why only the text re-themed.

The ratios here are computed from RESOLVED computed styles in each theme, never from an expected
hex: a test that pinned the colour would pass on any wrong colour typed in later.
