"""Measured latency probe for `GET /api/system-status`, before and after the snapshot owner.

This module measures; it does not assert a product budget. It exists because the queue item that
moved this route onto a background snapshot required a NUMBER for the first-request (cold) path and
for the steady state, taken to one stated protocol, on both sides of the change.

The protocol, fixed here so a later run cannot quietly redefine it:

* the headline quantity is SERVER HANDLER TIME - route entry to response serialization - read back
  out of the server's own per-request performance ring (`app.performance_records`, role
  `http-endpoint`, surface `GET /api/system-status`), not timed by the client;
* CLIENT ROUND TRIP is recorded beside it as a separate number and never substituted for it;
* the sample is `SAMPLE_REQUESTS` requests after `WARMUP_REQUESTS` discarded warmup requests, at a
  stated fixed concurrency (`CONCURRENCY`, default 1, recorded in the artifact either way);
* the COLD request is the very first `/api/system-status` this server process ever answers, taken
  before any warmup and reported on its own - averaging it into the sample is what hid it before;
* the snapshot publish cadence and the freshness deadline in force are recorded with the sample,
  because a steady-state number means nothing without the cadence that produced it;
* `loadavg` is recorded as an observed side fact only. It is ambient noise, not a workload, and the
  artifact labels it that way so it cannot later be cited as the load condition.

Run it explicitly; it is skipped in the gate because a pre-change run costs about a minute of real
route assembly:
