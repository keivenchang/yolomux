"""A down local service must be an attributable error, and an absent-by-design one must not.

The 0.7.0 QA incident: ``indexd`` was not running, Quick Open still answered from a
stale on-disk snapshot, and the Local-services row said only "Service did not report
healthy status" -- while the registry held the real, specific reason that
``_record_blocked_start`` had recorded. These tests pin both halves: the reason must
reach the row, and a demand-started service that nobody has asked for yet must NOT
raise an alarm.
