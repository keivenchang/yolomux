"""M2 and M3 of DOIT.p0.daemon-monitor: the watchd decision, and the extracted collector.

M2 -- watchd is observed WITHOUT calling its status RPC. `WatchClient.runtime_status`
exists and stays uncalled from production, because reaching it from a diagnostics path
demand-starts a demand-scoped service. Its identity and uptime come from the persisted
service record instead, which costs one file read and no traffic at all.

M3 -- `runtime_local_services()` is now a render of one immutable snapshot produced by
`LocalServicesCollector`. Every service, including statsd, is one named row producer;
statsd's row is no longer an inline dict literal inside the projection.

Every assertion here is a negative control as well as a positive one: the poisoned-input
tests below (`..._is_rejected`) are the permanent proof that the guard actually fires,
because a guard nobody has watched go red is a guard nobody has tested.

    The projection cannot import `_transition_totals` -- `backend_health/observer.py` imports THIS

    The owner's answer therefore arrives inside the document instead, which leaves one direction

    published `True` must be a value the owner would also have resolved to `True`.

    That is the direction the whole subsystem keeps failing in -- `-1`, `True`, `'1'` and `'true'`
    were all laundered into claims of completeness by a branch that asked the wrong question.
    Measured: swapping this layer back to `bool(...)` turns `'true'`, `1` and `'false'` into
    exactness claims and fails this test 3 ways. The store's own truth table
    (`test_the_counter_owner_answers_presence_and_validity_separately`) pins the other side.

    The residual gap is stated rather than hidden: because the answer travels in the document and
    not through an import, this layer can still LOSE a claim on a raw record the store never
    normalized -- an absent flag beside a usable total reads as `False` here and `True` in the
