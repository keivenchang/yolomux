"""Host CPU sampling backs off only while nobody is watching stats.

The saving is real but it is bounded by one hard requirement: one-second in-memory UI freshness
is not negotiable. So the contract is not "sample less" -- it is "sample less ONLY while
unwatched, and resume immediately the instant a watcher returns", which is a STATE TRANSITION and
cannot be established by asserting a steady state in each mode separately.
