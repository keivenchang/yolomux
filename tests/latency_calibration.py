"""Calibration, host qualification and fixed-ceiling verdicts for the exclusive certification phase.

One owner for three ideas that used to be fused or copied:

* the fixed independent browser work unit and its declared reference envelope,
* host resource qualification - may this box certify anything at all right now,
* the fixed-ceiling verdict - a ceiling is a product budget and is never scaled by a host.

Calibration decides WHETHER, and which statistic, may be certified. It never decides how slow the
product may be. A host outside the declared envelope produces ``NOT CERTIFIABLE`` with its raw
evidence; it never produces a skip that passes and never produces a multiplied ceiling.

# frame, because the probe crosses a requestAnimationFrame boundary and 16.7 ms is that floor - it
# says the fixed work unit fitted inside a single frame, not that the CPU ran at a given speed.
#
# CALIBRATION_ADMISSION_MS is the ADMISSION envelope: beyond it no verdict may be reached at all
# and the unit returns NOT CERTIFIABLE. It is 1.5 frames. Measured 2026-08-08 on keivenc-linux1
# across nine exclusive-phase runs (63 raw samples): quiet raw samples 15.4-19.4 ms, per-round p75
# 16.6-19.2 ms, so a frame-quantised probe routinely lands just past one frame and the reference
# value alone refused five of nine otherwise-qualified runs. No observed sample reached two frames
# (33.3 ms). The envelope therefore admits a host that spills partially into a second frame and

    "Held out from that calibration, three further complete gates on ac0f27bfa with no external "

    "qualified - and replaying the retired limits over those same 15 refuses 2 of them: a "
    "preflight at procs_running p75 14.0 against 12.0 and a postflight at disk in-flight 17 "
    "against 8.0, which is two of those three gates lost to EXIT 4. "
    "The two fixed work units report a MEDIAN, not a rank near the maximum. The retired "

    "and 20.578 ms during a live gate whose other signals were all inside their limits. The "
    "retired `storage_work_p75_ms` did the same: one of 30 baseline probes reported 15.092 ms "
    "against its 12.0 limit while that probe's median was 6.42 ms. "
    "The CPU work unit does NOT discriminate gate load on this box and its limit is a saturation "
    "guard only. Pinning the same unit to one logical CPU measured 9.0-9.7 ms on P-cores, "
    "15.8-16.2 ms on E-cores and 12.3-17.2 ms on a P-core whose SMT sibling became busy, so core "
    "placement alone spans 1.7x with no change in host load - wider than the shift a real gate "
    "produces. Measured medians: baseline 9.0-16.4 ms, real gate 9.0-25.4 ms (overlapping the "
    "baseline over its whole lower range), 96-worker saturation 17.1-65.0 ms. "
    "io full-stall and the storage work unit likewise did NOT separate the populations - their "
    "limits are broad guards against a device-bound or cold-cache read (a cold page_before "
    "measured 365 ms against 58-72 ms warm), not discriminators of gate load. "
    "The signals that DO separate are procs_running p75 (baseline 4-22 against 95-120 saturated; "
    "it refuses 171 of the 220 gate-loaded probes and 19 of 19 saturated ones), cpu some-stall "
    "(0.001-0.211 against 0.744-0.815, refusing 144 of 220), disk busy (0.047-0.355 against "
    "0.950-0.988, refusing 106 of 220) and io some-stall (0.001-0.007 against 0.089-0.114, "
    "refusing 82 of 220). Replaying all three populations through the retired and the current "
    "configuration refuses exactly the same probes - 8 of 30 baseline, 173 of 220 gate-loaded, 19 "
    "of 19 saturated - so the median costs no refusal of a loaded host and removes a false one. "
    "`disk_in_flight_max` now carries no threshold at all; the measured reason is in "
    "HOST_QUALIFICATION_EVIDENCE_ONLY and it is reported beside its own p75 and per-device split "
    "in every measurement so the next reader can see why. The windowed statistic the retired note "
    "asked for was measured and does not rescue it: over the same probes the per-device p75 is 0 "
    "post-lane and 1-3 saturated, which is a threshold of exactly 1 on an integer that is 0 in "
    "more than three quarters of every probe's reads, and it adds nothing that "
    "disk_busy_fraction_max and io_stall_some_fraction do not already carry with 2.0x and 1.5x "
